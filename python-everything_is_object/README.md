# Python - Everything Is Object

This project delves into the fundamental concept in Python that everything is an object. It explores the nuances of mutable and immutable objects, assignment and aliasing, object identity, and the implications these have on Python programming.

## Background Context

Understanding that everything in Python is an object is crucial for effective programming. This project encourages a deep dive into how Python manages different types of objects, the concept of mutability vs. immutability, and how variables and objects relate to each other in memory.

## Objectives

- Understand what an object is in Python.
- Differentiate between classes and instances.
- Grasp the distinction between mutable and immutable objects.
- Comprehend references and assignments.
- Learn about aliasing and its effects.
- Identify when and why two variables are identical.
- Understand how Python treats mutable and immutable objects differently.
- Explore how Python passes variables to functions.

## Requirements

### Python Scripts

- Use vi, vim, or emacs as editors.
- All files should be executable and written in Python 3 (3.8.5), tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines.
- Include a shebang line: `#!/usr/bin/python3`.

### Documentation

- Provide a `README.md` file at the root of the project directory.
- Document your code and adhere to best practices.

## Tasks

Each task in this project is aimed at exploring a specific aspect of Python's object model. They range from understanding how to print the type of an object, to more complex tasks like cloning lists and understanding the implications of mutable objects passed as function arguments.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this project, you should be able to articulate:

- How Python's object model works.
- The difference between mutable and immutable objects and why it matters.
- The relationship between variables and objects in Python.
- How Python's function arguments handle mutable and immutable objects.
