# Python - Exceptions

This project is part of the Holberton School higher level programming curriculum. It aims to teach about exceptions in Python, how to handle them, and the difference between errors and exceptions.

## Learning Objectives

- Why Python programming is awesome
- What’s the difference between errors and exceptions
- What are exceptions and how to use them
- When do we need to use exceptions
- How to correctly handle an exception
- What’s the purpose of catching exceptions
- How to raise a builtin exception
- When do we need to implement a clean-up action after an exception

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.8.5)
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Code should use the `pycodestyle` (version 2.7.*)
- All files must be executable
- The length of files will be tested using `wc`

## Tasks

### 0. Safe list printing

Write a function that prints `x` elements of a list.

- Prototype: `def safe_print_list(my_list=[], x=0):`
- `my_list` can contain any type (integer, string, etc.)
- All elements must be printed on the same line followed by a new line.
- `x` represents the number of elements to print
- Returns the real number of elements printed

### 1. Safe printing of an integers list

Write a function that prints an integer with `"{:d}".format()`.

- Prototype: `def safe_print_integer(value):`
- The integer should be printed followed by a new line
- Returns `True` if value has been correctly printed (it means the value is an integer)
- Otherwise, returns `False`
