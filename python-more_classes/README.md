# Python - More Classes and Objects

## Overview
This project, part of the Holberton School curriculum, delves into advanced OOP concepts in Python, focusing on classes, objects, and special methods.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand OOP, classes, objects, instances, attributes, and methods in Python.
- Grasp data abstraction, encapsulation, properties, and the difference between public, protected, and private attributes.
- Learn about special methods like `__init__`, `__str__`, `__repr__`, and `__del__`.

## Requirements
- Code tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5.
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines.
- All files must start with `#!/usr/bin/python3` and be executable.

## Tasks
- **0. Simple rectangle:** Define an empty class `Rectangle`.
- **1. Real definition of a rectangle:** Add private `width` and `height` attributes with their getters and setters.
- **2. Area and Perimeter:** Implement `area` and `perimeter` methods for `Rectangle`.
- **3. String representation:** Add `__str__` method to return a printable representation of `Rectangle`.
- **4. Eval is magic:** Implement `__repr__` method for class instance reconstruction using `eval()`.
- **5. Detect instance deletion:** Customize instance deletion message with `__del__` method.
- **6. How many instances:** Add a class attribute to track the number of `Rectangle` instances.
- **7. Change representation:** Allow customization of the symbol used for string representation.
- **8. Compare rectangles:** Add a static method to compare the areas of two `Rectangle` instances.
- **9. A square is a rectangle:** Introduce a class method to create a square as a `Rectangle` instance.
