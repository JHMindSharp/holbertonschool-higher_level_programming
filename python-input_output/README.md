# Python - Input/Output

## Description

This project is part of the Holberton School Higher Level Programming curriculum. It aims to teach about file handling in Python, including reading, writing, appending, and JSON serialization/deserialization.

## Learning Objectives

- How to open, read, write, and append to files in Python.
- Understanding the `with` statement for file handling.
- Learning about JSON serialization and deserialization.
- Working with JSON in Python using the `json` module.
- How to use exceptions to manage file handling errors.

## Requirements

- All files are interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.8.5).
- All files end with a new line.
- The first line of all files is exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- Code uses the `pycodestyle` (version 2.7.*) for styling.
- All files must be executable.
- The length of files will be tested using `wc`.

## Files and Descriptions

- `0-read_file.py`: Function that reads a text file (UTF8) and prints it to stdout.
- `1-write_file.py`: Function that writes a string to a text file (UTF8) and returns the number of characters written.
- `2-append_write.py`: Function that appends a string at the end of a text file (UTF8) and returns the number of characters added.
- `3-to_json_string.py`: Function that returns the JSON representation of an object (string).
- `4-from_json_string.py`: Function that returns an object (Python data structure) represented by a JSON string.
- `5-save_to_json_file.py`: Function that writes an Object to a text file, using a JSON representation.
- `6-load_from_json_file.py`: Function that creates an Object from a "JSON file".
- `7-add_item.py`: Script that adds all arguments to a Python list and then saves them to a file.
- `8-class_to_json.py`: Function that returns the dictionary description with simple data structure (list, dictionary, string, integer, and boolean) for JSON serialization of an object.
- `9-student.py`: Class `Student` that defines a student by certain attributes.
- `10-student.py`: Based on `9-student.py`, adds a method to retrieve a dictionary representation of a Student instance.
- `11-student.py`: Based on `10-student.py`, adds a method to replace all attributes of the Student instance.
- `12-pascal_triangle.py`: Function that returns a list of lists of integers representing the Pascal's triangle of `n`.
