# Python - Classes and Objects

This project introduces the concept of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. Through this project, you'll get hands-on experience with classes, objects, attributes, methods, and much more.

## Background Context

Understanding OOP is crucial for any Python developer. This project requires reading various resources to grasp the basics and subtleties of OOP in Python.

## Learning Objectives

- What is OOP and "first-class everything" in Python
- Understanding classes and objects and how they differ
- The importance and usage of attributes and methods
- The special `__init__` method and how to use it for initialization
- Concepts of data abstraction, encapsulation, and information hiding
- The use of public, protected, and private attributes
- How to dynamically create new attributes for class instances
- Understanding Python's property feature and the Pythonic way to use getters and setters

## Requirements

- All files should end with a new line
- Your code should use the `pycodestyle` standard
- All your files must be executable
- Documentation for each module, class, and method is mandatory

## Tasks

### 0. My First Square
Write an empty class `Square` that defines a square.

### 1. Square with Size
Expand the `Square` class to include a private instance attribute `size`.

### 2. Size Validation
Add validation to the `size` attribute: it must be an integer and greater than or equal to 0.

### 3. Area of a Square
Implement a public instance method that returns the area of the square.

### 4. Access and Update Private Attribute
Implement a property and setter for the `size` attribute to control its access and validation.

### 5. Printing a Square
Add a public instance method to print the square using the `#` character.

### 6. Coordinates of a Square
Extend the `Square` class to include a `position` attribute with its getter and setter, and use it when printing the square.

## More Info

Remember to experiment with OOP by yourself. Playing with classes and objects will help you understand the concepts better.
