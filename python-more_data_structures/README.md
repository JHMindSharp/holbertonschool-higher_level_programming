# Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary

This project, guided by Guillaume, is part of the curriculum at Holberton School. The focus is on learning more about data structures in Python, specifically sets and dictionaries, along with lambda, filter, reduce, and map functions.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, learners should be able to explain:

- Why Python programming is awesome
- How to use sets and their common methods
- The differences between sets, lists, and when to use each
- How to iterate through a set
- How to use dictionaries and their key-value structure
- The differences between dictionaries, sets, and lists
- What constitutes a key in a dictionary and how to iterate through a dictionary
- The purpose and use of lambda functions
- How to use map, reduce, and filter functions

## Requirements

- All files are interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5).
- All files should end with a new line.
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- Code should use the `pycodestyle` style (version 2.7.*).
- All files must be executable.
- The length of files will be tested using `wc`.

## Tasks

### 0. Squared simple

Write a function that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix.

- Prototype: `def square_matrix_simple(matrix=[]):`
- No modules allowed.

### 1. Search and replace

Write a function that replaces all occurrences of an element by another in a new list.

- Prototype: `def search_replace(my_list, search, replace):`
- No modules allowed.

### [Further tasks continue...]

## Testing

Examples for testing your functions can be found in the project description. Ensure to test your functions thoroughly to catch any edge cases.
